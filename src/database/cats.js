      "This SWEET siamese baby was brought into our primary animal hospital, West Hills Animal Hospital, by a woman who had just bought her at a pet store just days prior. This poor kitten was diagnosed with FIP. The woman contacted the pet store in which she was purchased and the pet store told her to just put the kitten down and he will work on giving her a refund. The woman was notified of the possible solutions to save this kitten from FIP, but she just wanted her money back from the store and wanted to continue with euthanizing. West Hills knew that there was no way they could put this sweet sweet kitten to rest, and had the woman surrender this kitten if they found a rescue to take her under their wing, something we could NOT pass up! This little girl is such a love bug and we want to give her the second chance at a beautiful life that she so much deserves! Help us with her FIP medication by donating!",
